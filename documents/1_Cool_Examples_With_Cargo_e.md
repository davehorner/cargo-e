### Cool Examples That Deserve Mention

Cargo‑e is built to work seamlessly with a wide variety of Rust projects—from simple programs to complex examples and binaries. Whether you're testing a creative project or a robust application, cargo‑e aims to make running and exploring your code as effortless as possible. Below are some cool examples that have been tried and tested on my machines:

- [altunenes/rusty_art](https://github.com/altunenes/rusty_art)
- [altunenes/cuneus](https://github.com/altunenes/cuneus)
- [nannou](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou)

Your project, program, example, sample, or what have you should work fine with cargo‑e. If you know of other great examples, tests, or binaries that integrate well with cargo‑e, please share them. And if cargo‑e doesn't work as expected with your project, I'd love to hear your feedback so we can make it even better.
